# SPSS .NET Interop library

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/andrewarnott/OSS/_apis/build/status/SPSS.NET)](https://dev.azure.com/andrewarnott/OSS/_build/latest?definitionId=23&branchName=master)

[![NuGet package](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/SPSS.NET.svg)](https://nuget.org/packages/SPSS.NET)

A .NET library for read/writing SPSS Data (.sav) files. This wraps the functionality exposed by the spssio32.dll native library that comes with SPSS.

[SPSS][1] is a statistical software application popular among students and researchers.

Recently updated to include spssio32.dll from SPSS 15 and to work with that version and possibly later versions.

See also the [SPSSLib][2] CodePlex project which has the same goals as this project, but without using spssio32.dll
